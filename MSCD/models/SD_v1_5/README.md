# Pruned Stable Diffusion v1.5

We use the pruned Stable Diffusion v1.5 model from the [IDM](https://github.com/Guaishou74851/IDM/tree/main) codebase as our backbone. The weights are from the official checkpoint [stable-diffusion-v1-5](https://huggingface.co/stable-diffusion-v1-5/stable-diffusion-v1-5), and the following files from IDM are reused:

- `model.py`
- `forward.py`
- `backprop.py`
